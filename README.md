Students can get intimdated by larger statistical data or facts, a game allows for students to get the information in a considerably fun way. The game we designed seeks to educate players about the dangers of carbonn emission and global warrming in an engaging and entertaining manner. As players, you guide the local bird through a polluted skyline, dodgin clouds of smog and emissions, they learn about the impacts of human activity on the environment. The project aims to instill a sense of responsibility and inspire action among players to combat climate change.
